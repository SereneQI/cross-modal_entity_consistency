## News

**3rd June 2020:** We uploaded a **pre-release** of the *TamperedNews* and *News400* dataset with links to news texts, 
news images, and reference images. In addition, we provide the splits for validation and testing including the sets of 
untampered and tampered entities for each document. We are currently working on a script to download the news texts and 
images as well as the source code to reproduce our results.
