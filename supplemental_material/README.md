# Supplemental Material

## Multimodal Analytics for Real-world News using Measures of Cross-modal Entity Consistency

Additional result tables can be found [here](supplemental_material.pdf). They contain the following experiments:
- Evaluation of images sources and the number of references images
- Document verification results for the evaluation of different operators to combine the cross-modal similarities of all reference images to the news image for each entity (as explained in Section 3.3 of the paper)
- Results of more subsets for both TamperedNews and News400

Due to licensing restrictions we have used similar images to the original news photos in the paper. You can find
